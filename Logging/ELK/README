simply run:
bash do_it_for_me.sh `pwd`

then go to your browser and enter:
http://<server_name>:9200/_cat/indices?v

you should see a message immediately, but give it about a minute and you should see something like:

health status index               uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
